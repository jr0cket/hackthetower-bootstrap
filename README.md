hackthetower-bootstrap
======================

Hack the Tower is a hack day run in London for any developers out there in the community.  This is a simple website to add more detail to the event, so developers know what to expect.

The site will also have details of the next events, the venue for each event, where to sign up and contact details for the organisers.

It is hoped that the site will also include details of projects people have worked on, or links to write-ups about the events.

This website also represents my (jr0cket) first attempts at creating a "responsive" website using Twitter bootstrap.  Hopefully the lessons I learn can be used to help others new to Twitter bootstrap to get going quickly.  Therefore I wont be using anything too out there or too complicated (eve if it looks cool).

Thank you
